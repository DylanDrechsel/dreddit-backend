Dreddit is a Reddit clone that allows users to have all the same CRUD functionality that one would have on Reddit. Users are able to create and edit posts, upload images, comment on other users posts, save post for later that they are able to access, and I even implamented the upvote/downvote system that Reddit has. I tried to make the HTML in Dreddit look as much as Reddit as possible.
