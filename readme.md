Dreddit is a Reddit clone that allows users to have all the same CRUD functionality that one would have on Reddit. Users must create an account to get authenticated and once created are able to sign in and use the functionality of Dreddit. Users can create and edit posts, upload images, comment on other usersâ€™ posts, save post for later that they are able to access, and I even implemented the upvote/downvote system that Reddit has. I tried to make the HTML in Dreddit look as much as Reddit as possible. Post pictures you want people to see or use Dreddit as an outlet to talk about all your passions. All are welcome here!

## Key features:
- Used Postgresql as my database
- Used Amazons aws-sdk along with S3 to allow users to upload pictures to Dreddit while their hosted on Amazon S3 
- Used bcrypt to keep users password secure by hashing them before they are stored in the database
